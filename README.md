# Automatidata
Project Goal

Develop a user-friendly mobile app for New York City taxi riders that enables them to estimate fares in advance, compare prices across different payment methods (cash, credit card, mobile app), and plan their journeys efficiently. This can empower riders to make informed choices and potentially save money, while providing valuable data insights to the NYC TLC for fare structure optimization.

Background

Automatidata conducted an exploratory analysis using a comprehensive dataset of historical NYC taxi trip records. Initial findings suggest potential variations in fare amounts based on payment type. However, further investigation is required to draw statistically significant conclusions.

Scenario

The New York City TLC would like the data team at Automatidata to analyze the relationship between fare amounts and payment type. To investigate this relationship further, the data team proposes conducting a hypothesis test. Our hypothesis is that average fare amounts differ significantly depending on the chosen payment method. 
Deliverables 
	Compute descriptive statistics
	Conduct a hypothesis test using the New York City TLC dataset
	Create an executive summary for the Automatidata data team before sharing the results with the client

note that this is a ficticious scenario, it is just meant to practice statistical concepts
